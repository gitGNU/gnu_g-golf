#+TITLE: GNU Gbank TODO file

* TODO [50%]

- [ ] gbank-ir-find-by-* should return #f if no gtype is found
- [ ] gbank-* procs to return #f, not %null-pointer when they fail
- [X] verify gbank-ci-get-caller-owns returned value

  The manual says it returns TRUE if the caller owns the return value,
  FALSE otherwise, but the function definition, in the manualstill, is

	GITransfer
	g_callable_info_get_caller_owns (GICallableInfo *info);

  Done, I talked to ebassy on #introspection and he fixed the bug in the
  manual: this functionindeed returns a GITransfer enum value,
