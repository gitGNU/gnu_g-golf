G-Golf GObject modules are defined in the @code{gi/gobject}
subdirectory, such as @code{(g-golf gi gobject enum-flags)}.

Where you may load these modules individually, the easiest way to use
G-Golf is to import the @code{gi gobject} module: it imports and
re-exports the public interface of (oop goops), (system foreign), all
G-Golf support and G-Golf GObject modules:

@lisp
(use-modules (g-golf gi gobject))
@end lisp

G-Golf low level API modules correspond to a GObject section, though
they might be some exception in the future.

* Enumeration and Flag Types::  Gobject Enumeration and Flag Types.
