G-Golf GObject Introspection modules are defined in the @code{gi}
subdirectory, such as @code{(g-golf gi repository)}.

Where you may load these modules individually, the easiest way to use
G-Golf is to import the @code{gi} module: it imports and re-exports the
public interface of (oop goops), (ice-9 binary-ports), (rnrs
bytevectors), (system foreign), all G-Golf support and G-Golf GObject
Introspection modules:

@lisp
(use-modules (g-golf gi))
@end lisp

Most G-Golf low level API modules correspond to a GObject Intropection
section, but there are some exceptions, such as @code{init},
@code{utils} and @code{types} @dots{}
