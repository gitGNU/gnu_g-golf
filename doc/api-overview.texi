@node API Overview
@subsection API Overview


@subheading G-Golf Low Level API

The G-Golf low level API is the part of the G-Golf API where [almost all]
procedures are a one to one binding to their corresponding @code{GI}
(@code{Glib} and @code{GObject}) function, and both arguments and
returned values are pointers, except for enums, strings, numbers and
booleans.

As an example. you may already do:

@lisp
,use (g-golf gi)
(golf-ir-require "Clutter")
@print{}
$2 = #<pointer 0x1681600>
@end lisp


@subheading G-Golf High Level API

G-Golf will also provide a higher level API, using GOOPS (@pxref{GOOPS,,,
guile, The GNU Guile Reference Manual}), as it has been done for
@uref{@value{UGG}, Guile-Gnome}.


@indentedblock
@strong{Special Note:}

This means that somewhere in between this initial @value{VERSION}
version and 0.1.0, or maybe 0.2.0, we probably will break the above
arguments and returned values statement, so that where ever appropriate,
these will become GOOPS classes and instances for the G-Golf low level
API as well, except for enums, strings, numbers and booleans.

Once we will be happy with the design and will have tested it on a
wrapper, let's say @code{Clutter}, once we will have fixed all manual
entries, then we will remove this special note.

Till then, code and design review is more then welcome, testing upon a
wrapper is welcome too, but be well aware of this special note, and keep
in mind that things may change in a way that either version 0.1.0 or
0.2.0 will probably break earlier G-Golf user code, that you must
consider, till then, experimental.
@end indentedblock

G-Golf higher level API will follow @uref{@value{UGG}, Guile-Gnome}'s
naming conventions for classes, slot names, generic functions and
methods (see the next section @ref{Naming Conventions} for further
details).

Until the above @strong{Special Note} disappears from G-Golf's Reference
Manual, you won't be able to try the following code snipset, but here is
what you will be able to do, at least this is the idea, once the higher
level API will exist:

@lisp
,use (g-golf gi)
(golf-ir-require "Clutter")
@c @print{}
@c $2 = #<<gi-typelib> 18237a0>
(make <clutter-stage>)
@print{}
$3 = #<<clutter-stage> 22782a0>
@end lisp


@node Naming Conventions
@subsubsection Naming Conventions


@subheading GI Funtions

G-Golf low level API procedure names that bind a GI function always start
with @code{golf-}, followed by two letters and an hyphen, representing
the GObject Introspection section (@xref{Abreviations}), followed by the
section function name it implements. For example, from the GIRepository
section:

@example
g_irepository_get_loaded_namespaces
->
@ref{golf-ir-get-loaded-namespaces}
@end example


@subheading GI Types and Values

G-Golf low level API variables that bind GI types and values use the
exact same convention as for procedures, except that they always start
with @code{%golf-}.  For example, from the GIBaseInfo section:

@example
GIInfoType
->
@ref{%golf-bi-info-type}
@end example

Note: The G-Golf Reference Manual follows the GObject Introspection
manual and list 'Types and Values' in their corresponding section. for
example @ref{Base Info}. However, in the G-Golf source code, all 'Types
and Values' are defined in the @code{(g-golf gi types)} module, which we
think is more convenient both for developers and G-Golf users.


@subheading G-Golf

G-Golf does not just bind the @code{GObject Introspection} library, that
would not buy us much.  It comes with its own set of procedures, syntax
and variables, aimed at not just reading a typelib, but making its
functionality available from @uref{@value{UGUILE}, Guile}.

G-Golf procedure and syntax names also always start with @code{golf-}
followed by their name: the name, however, will never start neither
contain anywhere else the two reserved letters followed by a hyphen used
for @code{GI}, @code{Glib} and @code{GObject} functions, types and
variable (@xref{Abreviations}).

G-Golf variables follow the same above described rule except that their
name starts with @code{%golf-}.


@subheading Exceptions

There are two exceptions with respect to the naming conventions
described above:

@enumerate a
@item
procedure names that start with @code{call-with-input-},
@code{call-with-output-} followed by a GI, Glib or GObject type, such
as:

@example
@ref{call-with-input-typelib}
@end example

@item
syntax names that start as @code{with-} followed by a GI, Glib or GObject
type, such as:

@example
with-gerror @c @ref{with-gerror}
@end example
@end enumerate


@subheading Gnome Libraries

Imported Gnome libraries will follow @uref{@value{UGG}, Guile-Gnome}'s
naming conventions, from which it will actually reuse the functionality
developed at the time (see @uref{@value{UGGMGOG}, 9.1.1 Mapping class
libraries to scheme} and @uref{@value{UGGMGOU}, 10.2 Usage} in @emph{the
GNU Guile-Gnome: GObject Refence Manual}). For example, the following
names would be transformed like this:

@lisp
ClutterActor -> clutter-actor
clutter_actor_new -> clutter-actor-new
clutter_actor_hide -> clutter-actor-hide
@dots{}
@end lisp

Once G-Golf high level API is also implemented, Gnome libraries GObject
classes and methods will become GOOPS citizen (@pxref{GOOPS,,, guile,
The GNU Guile Reference Manual}), and in the land of generic function
multi methods polimorphic object oriented systems, users just have fun:

@lisp
,use (g-golf gi)
(golf-ir-require "Clutter")
@print{}
$2 = #<<gi-typelib> 18237a0>
(make <clutter-actor>)
@print{}
$3 = #<<clutter-actor> 32124b0>
(hide $3)
@dots{}
@end lisp


@include api-abreviations.texi


@node G-Golf Modules
@subsubsection G-Golf Modules

G-Golf GObject Introspection modules are defined in the @code{gi}
subdirectory, such as @code{(g-golf gi repository)}.

Where you may load these modules individually, the easiest way to use
G-Golf is to import the @code{gi} module: it imports and re-exports the
public interface of (oop goops), (ice-9 binary-ports), (rnrs
bytevectors), (system foreign), all G-Golf support and G-Golf GObject
Introspection modules:

@lisp
(use-modules (g-golf gi))
@end lisp

Most G-Golf low level API modules correspond to a GObject Intropection
section, except for @code{init}, @code{utils} and @code{types}.
