Note: in this section, the @var{info} argument is [must be] a pointer to
a @code{GIRegisteredTypeInfo}.


@anchor{g-golf-rt-get-type-name}
@deffn Procedure g-golf-rt-get-type-name info

Returns the type name.

Obtain the type name of the struct within the GObject type system. This
type can be passed to g_type_name() to get a GType.
@end deffn


@anchor{g-golf-rt-get-type-init}
@deffn Procedure g-golf-rt-get-type-init info

Returns the name of the type init function.

Obtain the type init function for @var{info}. The type init function is
the function which will register the @code{GType} within the
@code{GObject} type system. Usually this is not called by langauge
bindings or applications.
@end deffn


@anchor{g-golf-rt-get-g-type}
@deffn Procedure g-golf-rt-get-g-type info

Returns the @code{GType}. FIXME when this effectively works.

Obtain the @code{GType} for this registered type or @code{G_TYPE_NONE}
which a special meaning. It means that either there is no type
information associated with this info or that the shared library which
provides the type_init function for this info cannot be called.
